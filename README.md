This BepInEx plugin for the game As Dusk Falls features:
- Ultrawide support with pillarbox removal.
- Intro/logos skip.
- 30 FPS cap removal.
- Graphical tweaks.

### Quick Ultrawide Fix
- If you would like an alternative solution that fixes ultrawide support then I highly recommend using [@RoseTheFlower](https://github.com/RoseTheFlower)'s fix which you can find [here](https://github.com/RoseTheFlower/UltrawideIndex/releases/tag/asduskfalls).

## Installation
- Grab the latest release of AsDuskFallsFix from [here.](https://github.com/Lyall/AsDuskFallsFix/releases)
- Extract the contents of the release zip in to the game directory.<br />(e.g. "**Xbox\As Dusk Falls\Content**" for Xbox/MS Store).
- Run the game once to generate a config file located at **<GameDirectory>\BepInEx\config\AsDuskFallsFix.cfg**
- The first launch may take a little while as BepInEx does its magic.

## Configuration
- See the generated config file to adjust various aspects of the plugin.

## Known Issues
